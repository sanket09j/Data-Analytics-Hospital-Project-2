# Data-Analytics-Hospital-Project-2
Visualizes ER performance in real-time using Power BI. Tracks patient volume, wait times, common cases, and resource utilization to optimize hospital efficiency and enhance patient care.

Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard (Power BI Project)

📘 Project Overview
The Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard provides a comprehensive view of emergency room operations and patient flow.
It allows hospital management and healthcare analysts to monitor patient admissions, waiting times, satisfaction levels, and departmental referrals to improve decision-making and service quality.

🎯 Objective
.To analyze emergency room data and visualize key performance metrics such as:
.Patient demographics (age, gender, race)
.Wait time efficiency
.Department referrals
.Admission status and satisfaction scores
.The goal is to identify bottlenecks, enhance patient experience, and optimize hospital resource allocation.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
.Power BI (Dashboard creation, DAX calculations, data modeling)
.Excel / CSV (Data Source)
.Power Query (Data cleaning and transformation)

📈 Dashboard Insights
